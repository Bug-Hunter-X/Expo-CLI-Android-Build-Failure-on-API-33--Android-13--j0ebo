The solution involves updating the `android/app/build.gradle` file and/or the `android/gradle.properties` file to use compatible versions of the Android Gradle Plugin and other dependencies.  Specifically, you might need to adjust the `compileSdkVersion`, `minSdkVersion`, and `targetSdkVersion` to match supported configurations.  Also, check and adjust the Android Gradle Plugin version used in the `build.gradle` file. Refer to Expo's documentation and Android Gradle Plugin release notes for the most up-to-date compatibility information.
